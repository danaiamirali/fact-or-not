The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[29]\nTickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[30] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[4]\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light.'}, {'url': 'https://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/eiffel-tower', 'content': 'Several hundred workers spent two years assembling the framework of the iconic lattice tower, which at its inauguration in March 1889 stood nearly 1,000 feet high and was the tallest structure in the world—a distinction it held until the completion of New York City’s Chrysler Building in 1930. Some 500 employees are responsible for its daily operations, working in its restaurants, manning its elevators, ensuring its security and directing the eager crowds flocking the tower’s platforms to enjoy panoramic views of the City of Lights.\n The Eiffel Tower Becomes a Permanent Feature of the Paris Skyline\nOriginally intended as a temporary exhibit, the Eiffel Tower was almost torn down and scrapped in 1909. Also during the German occupation of Paris, French resistance fighters famously cut the Eiffel Tower’s elevator cables so that the Nazis had to climb the stairs.\n The novelist Guy de Maupassant, for example, allegedly hated the tower so much that he often ate lunch in the restaurant at its base, the only vantage point from which he could completely avoid glimpsing its looming silhouette.\n'}, {'url': 'https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/the-monument', 'content': "This enthusiast and true genius was able to go beyond his own limits to bequeath to us monuments such as the dome on the Nice Observatory, the metallic structure of the Statue of Liberty, not to mention the Bordeaux railway brid...\nThe Eiffel Tower during the 1889 Exposition Universelle\nThe tenth Exposition Universelle was organised in Paris in 1889, from the 15th May to the 6th November, and it was for this occasion that the Eiffel Tower was built.

False.

Explanation: The statement is not entirely accurate. The boiling point of water can vary depending on factors such as altitude and atmospheric pressure. At sea level, water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, but this temperature can change at different elevations. For example, at higher altitudes, where the atmospheric pressure is lower, water boils at a lower temperature. 

The corrected statement would be:
"Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level, but the boiling point can vary at different elevations due to changes in atmospheric pressure."
